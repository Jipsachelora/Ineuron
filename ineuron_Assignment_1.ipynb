    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",

    "Expressions: -,/,+,*, all the above values can be an expression\n",
    "Note:  expression can be a combination of values and operators eg: 2+2 or Any value is an expression!\n",

    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "A variable is something that can hold a value.\n",
    "A string is one of many types of values(string is a sequence of characters)\n",

    "A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute\n",
    "\n",
    "foo = \"hello\" is a statement that assigns foo to the value of the expression \"hello\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the code \"hello\" is a simple expression, meaning it contains no operations, nothing is actually evaluated, so foo is just assigned to \"hello\". \n",
    "More complex expressions actually evaluate things, like adding numbers.\n",

    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: \n",
    "\n",
    "Rules for creating variables in Python\n",
    "A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.\n",
    "A variable name cannot start with a number.\n",
    "A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).\n",
    "Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name and NAME are three different variables).\n",
    "The reserved words(keywords) cannot be used naming the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence eggs is a valid variable name while 100 is invalid.\n",

    "\n",
    "ANS: \n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "99 is an integer and the other two are strings. So it is not possible to add str and int together. So we need to convert int to str as follows \n",
